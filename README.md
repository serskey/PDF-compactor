# PDF-compactor
Implement a web that allows users to upload a pdf file which might be huge (up to 30 MB) and return a compacted version of the file based on the user specified constraints (such as DPI).
Tools

frontend: Bootstrap4 + HTML + jQuery+ CSS
backend: Node.js + express
PDF Optimizer API : PDFtron.
Functions

User can set Quality and DPI to get different compressed size.

Quality: from 1 to 10 where 10 is lossless. There is an example:

Quality	DPI	Original zise	compressed size
1	100	8.9MB	2.59MB
10	100	8.9MB	4.20MB
1	50	8.9MB	1.57MB
Store the uploaded files in our own (NodeJS or Python) server.
